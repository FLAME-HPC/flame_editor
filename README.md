FLAME Editor
============
This repository has been migrated from svn to git. 

Function editor branch
----------------------
This branch was created in the orignal svn repository but it appears it was established as a folder in the `branches` directory, rather than as an `svn copy` from another branch or the trunk. This means branch merges will not function as expected as there will be no common history.
